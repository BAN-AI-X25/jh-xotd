jh-xotd
=======

A version of Stephane Fillod's xotd for Linux that allows use of more than
one xot remote and fixes some synchronisation bugs. This version uses a
standard "tun" device and works with modern 2.6.x versions of Linux 
(without x25tap patches).

The configuration file (-f option) now looks like:

# xotd configuration file

# Fields:
# 1. tun device (use "=" if you don't care, will be tun0, tun1...)
# 2. remote
# 3. setup script (use "=" if you don't want one)
# 4. VC's (256 if missing)

=       192.168.1.66   /etc/xotd/xotd-setup    256

The setup script is run with the name of the xot device as its only argument.
It should set the link into the "up" state. It is also good place to put x25
routing configuration, or setup x25 subscription options. For example:

#! /bin/sh -e
echo "Setting up $1" > /dev/console
ip link set $1 up
route --x25 add 0/0 $1
